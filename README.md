This Repository is for IS 117, this will give you an intro on Linux and Git commands as well as background
information on Git, Docker, automated testing, GitFlow, and continuous integration.

#### Git
Git is a version control system designed to handle everything small and large with projects with speed and efficiency. Git works with GitHub to make it easy for collaborators to work together remotely instead of being together.

#### Docker
Docker is a tool used to create, deploy and run applications using containers. Containers allow developers to package up an application with all of the parts it needs into one package.

#### Automated Testing
As the name suggests automated testing is testing an application automatically as compared to manual testing were you have to physically test it yourself. This saves time and effort because everything is automated. Typically Automated Testing is used for large projects and projects that needs to testing over and over again.

#### Continuous integration
Continuous integration is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository multiple times a day. This improves productivity cause what it does for head leaders in projects is find out who did what so they will be able to find out who is working and who is not. This grows competitiveness because now worker are able to receive credit that they should so more workers will try.
